# Suicide_Rate Case Study and Visualizations



## Description 
Suicide rate is a serious public problem. It is the act of intentionally causing oneâ€™s own death. The world health organization estimated that over 700,000 dies due to suicide every year. Many suicide happens impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with the stress of life. suicide was the second leading cause of death among the 25-35 year sold globally in 2016. Hence it is quite clear that suicide is a global concern that should be analyzed.
Hence, this project contains a case study, analysis and visualization of Suicide rate of some part of the country. 

## Code and resources used for this project 
* I used Jupiter notebook
* Packages used : pandas , numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
* You can access this dataset using this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016

## Data Cleaning
After downloading the data from GitHub, I needed to clean the data so that I can perform Exploratory data analysis. I made the following changes. 
*	Renamed some column names 
*	Removed duplicate column and column not needed
* Checked for outliers and cleaned it.

## Exporatory Data analysis
I looked at the distribution of the data and the value counts for various categorical values. After analyzing the data using python, I visualized it on Jupiter notebook and also on power BI, and below are the visualization preview.
